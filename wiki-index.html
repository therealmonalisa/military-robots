	<h2 id="history"> History </h2>
	<p> Broadly defined, military robots date back to World War II and the Cold War in the form of the German Goliath tracked mines and the Soviet teletanks. The MQB-1 Predator drone was when &quot;CIA officers began to see the first practical returns on their decade-old fantasy of using aerial robots to collect intelligence&quot;.<sup><a href="#r-1" target="_self">[1] </a></sup> </p>

	<p> The use of robots in warfare, although traditionally a topic for science fiction, is being researched as a possible future means of fighting wars. Already several military robots have been developed by various armies.</p>
	<p> Some believe the future of modern warfare will be fought by automated weapons systems. <sup> <a href="#r-2" target="_self">[2] </a></sup> The U.S. Military is investing heavily in research and development towards testing and deploying increasingly automated systems. The most prominent system currently in use is the unmanned aerial vehicle (IAI Pioneer &amp; RQ-1 Predator) which can be armed with Air-to-ground missiles and remotely operated from a command center in reconnaissance roles. DARPA has hosted competitions in 2004 &amp; 2005 to involve private companies and universities to develop unmanned ground vehicles to navigate through rough terrain in the Mojave Desert for a final prize of 2 Million. <sup><a href="#r-3" target="_self">[3]</a></sup> </p>
	<p> Artillery has seen promising research with an experimental weapons system named &quot;Dragon Fire II&quot; which automates loading and ballistics calculations required for accurate predicted fire, providing a 12-second response time to fire support requests. However, military weapons are prevented from being fully autonomous: they require human input at certain intervention points to ensure that targets are not within restricted fire areas as defined by Geneva Conventions for the laws of war. </p>
	<p>
	There have been some developments towards developing autonomous fighter jets and bombers. <sup><a href="#r-4" target="_self">[4]</a></sup> The use of autonomous fighters and bombers to destroy enemy targets is especially promising because of the lack of training required for robotic pilots, autonomous planes are capable of performing maneuvers which could not otherwise be done with human pilots (due to high amount of G-Force), plane designs do not require a life support system, and a loss of a plane does not mean a loss of a pilot. However, the largest draw back to robotics is their inability to accommodate for non-standard conditions. Advances in artificial intelligence in the near future may help to rectify this.

	<li> US Mechatronics has produced a working automated sentry gun and is currently developing it further for commercial and military use. </li>
	<li> MIDARS, a four-wheeled robot outfitted with several cameras, radar, and possibly a firearm, that automatically performs random or preprogrammed patrols around a military base or other government installation. It alerts a human overseer when it detects movement in unauthorized areas, or other programmed conditions. The operator can then instruct the robot to ignore the event, or take over remote control to deal with an intruder, or to get better camera views of an emergency. The robot would also regularly scan radio frequency identification tags (RFID) placed on stored inventory as it passed and report any missing items. </li>
